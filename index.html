  <p id="first">My favorite hobby is drawing. I am 11years old and I draw in my 6th class. Whenever I go to home I usually do some drawing. Drawing helps us to work our 2 brains at same time. Drawing is a great way to improve your creative skills and start thinking in a different way. Art shows you that there is normally more than one way to solve a problem. Art encourages open ended thinking and creativity. These can be really helpful for personal development and solving problems. People's imaginations have allowed them to create all of the things that we use and are surrounded by everyday.Drawing helps me discover, reflect on, and express myself.
    It helps me learn about myself. It helps me feel more happy and confident, and has given me an extra sense of identity and purpose in life. It keeps me honest with myself.
